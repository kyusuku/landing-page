# The Fundamentals

**The Fundamentals** is a simple landing page project created as part of my journey through **The Odin Project** curriculum. This is my second project, designed to practice and refine my understanding of HTML and CSS, with a focus on the **flexbox** property. The page introduces the four fundamental forces of the universe: Gravity, Electromagnetic Force, Strong Nuclear Force, and Weak Nuclear Force.
